Exercise 2 - Using 'Shabang' line
In this exercise, we will edit the script 'greet.sh' created in the previous exercise and make it an executable file.

This is done to ensure that the name of the script can be used like a command.

Adding this special line lets us specify the path to the interpreter of the script, which is 'bash' in this case.

Let us follow the below steps.

2.1 : Find the path to the interpreter.

The which command helps you find out the path of the command 'bash'.

which bash
In this case it returns the path '/bin/bash'.

2.2 : Edit the script 'greet.sh' and add the shabang line to the script.

Open the file and add the following line at the beginning of the script:

#! /bin/bash
The script should now look like the following:



2.3 Check the permissions of the script.

One more step needs to be completed to make 'greet.sh' completely executable by name.
Let us add the execute permission for the user on greet.sh.

chmod +x greet.sh
Verify if the execute permission is granted.

Generally, it is not a good idea to grant permissions to a script for all user, groups and others alike. It is more appropriate to limit the execute permission to only the owner.

To change permissions for greet.sh, run the command below:

chmod u+x greet.sh
Verify the permissions using the command below.

ls -l greet.sh
If you wish to grant execute permission to everyone you need to run the command chmod +x greet.sh

2.4 Execute the script.

Run the command given below to execute the shell script.

./greet.sh
The '.' here refers to the current directory. We are telling linux to execute the script greet.sh that is in the current directory.
